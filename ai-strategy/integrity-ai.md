# Integrity AI: Content Protection

<Info>
**The business case:** Automated content protection that scales infinitely while reducing revenue loss from leaks and piracy.
</Info>

## The Problem

Content leaks cost creators 20-40% of potential revenue. Manual monitoring is impossible at scale, and takedowns are slow and reactive. **Integrity AI changes the game.**

### Market Opportunity

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Revenue Protection" icon="shield-dollar">
    **Recoverable losses**

    Billions in creator revenue lost to piracy annually - massive TAM for protection solutions
  </Card>
  <Card title="Scale Challenge" icon="infinity">
    **Impossible manually**

    Monitoring millions of sites and platforms requires automation - humans can't scale
  </Card>
  <Card title="Speed Matters" icon="bolt">
    **Time is money**

    Every hour content remains leaked = lost revenue. Automated detection and response are critical

## How It Works

### Detection & Response

<Steps>
  <Step title="Content Fingerprinting">
    **Create unique signatures**

    Upload original content → system creates perceptual fingerprints that survive modifications (crops, filters, compression)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Continuous Monitoring">
    **Automated surveillance**

    AI monitors platforms and sites → detects unauthorized copies → assigns risk scores
  </Step>
  <Step title="Evidence Generation">
    **Instant documentation**

    Match detected → system auto-generates evidence pack with timestamps, screenshots, and proof of ownership
  </Step>
  <Step title="Guided Enforcement">
    **Streamlined takedowns**

    Creator receives alert + evidence + filing instructions → faster enforcement
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Trust & Safety

### Privacy-First Approach

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Hash-First" icon="fingerprint">
    **Minimal data storage**

    Content converted to fingerprints - originals stored only with consent
  </Card>
  <Card title="Consent Required" icon="hand">
    **No surprises**

    Advanced features like facial recognition require explicit opt-in
  </Card>
  <Card title="User Control" icon="sliders">
    **Full transparency**

    Complete data export and deletion capabilities
  </Card>
