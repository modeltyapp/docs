# Integrity AI (RemoveMyContent)

**Goal:** Reduce incidents and accelerate takedowns through intelligent content protection.

---

## Overview

Integrity AI powers the **RemoveMyContent (Vault)** product, providing automated content protection through perceptual hashing, similarity matching, and evidence generation. The system is designed with privacy-first principles and responsible AI practices.

## Guardrails

### Hash-First Processing

<Warning>
**Privacy protection:**
- Content converted to perceptual hashes immediately
- Full files not retained when hashing is sufficient
- Original content stored only with explicit consent
- Minimal data retention policies
</Warning>

### Consent Requirements

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Facial Recognition" icon="face-smile">
    **Explicit consent required** for any facial recognition features
  </Card>
  <Card title="Biometric Data" icon="fingerprint">
    **Opt-in only** for biometric content analysis
  </Card>
  <Card title="Advanced Detection" icon="radar">
    **Clear disclosure** for AI-powered monitoring scope
  </Card>
  <Card title="Data Retention" icon="clock">
    **User control** over how long data is retained
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### GDPR Alignment

<Accordion title="Data Minimization">
  Collect only what's necessary for protection; hashes preferred over full content.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Purpose Limitation">
  Data used solely for content protection; no secondary uses without consent.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Storage Limitation">
  Retention periods aligned with legal requirements; automatic deletion after monitoring ends.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="User Rights">
  Full access, portability, and deletion rights for all stored data.
</Accordion>
