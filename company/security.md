### Data Handling

- **Encryption in transit:** All data transmissions use TLS 1.3
- **Encryption at rest:** Database and storage encryption
- **Least-privilege:** Access limited to necessary services only
- **Audit trails:** Complete activity logging for compliance

### Vendor Diligence

- SLA reviews and continuous monitoring
- Incident response playbooks
- Regional routing where available
- Regular security assessments

## Privacy by Design

### Core Principles

<Accordion title="PII Minimization">
  We collect only the minimum personal information necessary to provide our services. Data retention policies ensure information is deleted when no longer needed.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Purpose Limitation">
  Personal data is used solely for the specific purposes disclosed at collection. No secondary use without explicit consent.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Consent & Transparency">
  - Clear disclosure of data collection and use
  - No facial recognition without explicit consent
  - Granular opt-in controls for features
  - Easy-to-understand privacy policies
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Portability">
  - Export functionality for wallet data
  - Media vault download capabilities
  - Machine-readable data formats (CSV, JSON)
  - Maintain value through statements, lineage, and tuned playbooks
</Accordion>

## Compliance

### Regulatory Approach

<Warning>
We route regulated features through **licensed partners** and disclose capabilities **post-audit**.
We avoid marketing claims beyond partner scope.
</Warning>

### Compliance via Partners

- **Financial services:** Routed through licensed fintech partners
- **KYC/KYB:** Jurisdiction-aware onboarding processes
- **Payment rails:** Compliant payout infrastructure
- **Data protection:** GDPR-aligned retention and processing

### Regional Considerations

- Data residency options where required
- Jurisdiction-specific compliance frameworks
- Local regulatory monitoring
- Adaptive compliance posture
