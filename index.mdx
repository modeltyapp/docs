# Modelty Docs (Investor-Facing)

Modelty is the **wallet-first** platform where creators **operate, protect, and monetize**.
We combine three products that reinforce each other:

- **Oruon (flagship)** — creator fintech wallet (balances, splits, statements, payouts, FX).
- **Ops (Sasha)** — creator operations AI (playbooks, nudges, smart replies).
- **RemoveMyContent (Vault)** — content integrity & takedowns (private beta).

Together they form a compounding flywheel: **money → operations → integrity → more money**—a privacy-first **system of record** that is difficult to replace.

<Note>
We keep sensitive metrics private. Investors can request detailed cohorts and unit economics under NDA in the **Investors** section.
