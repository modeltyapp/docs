## Lock-In Factor

<Tip>
**High switching cost through:**

- **Accumulated financial history** (statements, splits, transactions)
- **Tax compliance data** (difficult to recreate elsewhere)
- **Split rules and partnerships** (complex agreements encoded in platform)
- **Regulatory onboarding** (re-KYC required for new platform)
- **Integrated workflows** (Ops and Vault depend on wallet signals)
</Tip>
