## How They Work Together

### The Compounding Flywheel

1. **Money Gravity (Oruon)**
   Creators start with the wallet for compliant earnings and payouts. This becomes their **financial system of record**.

2. **Workflow Gravity (Ops)**
   AI operations layer uses wallet signals to provide **intelligent guidance** that increases earnings and reduces support load.

3. **Integrity Gravity (Vault)**
   Content protection creates **defensible proof of ownership** and enables enforcement, protecting revenue streams.

4. **Reinforcement Loop**
   Higher earnings → more protection needs → better operations → increased earnings

## Value Proposition by Product

### Oruon: Financial Infrastructure

**What It Does:**
- Compliant KYC/KYB onboarding
- Sub-wallets and split rules
- Multi-currency balances & FX
- Tax-ready statements and exports
- Role-based access controls

**Why It Matters:**
Centralizes the creator's financial history, making it indispensable for daily operations and tax compliance.

**Lock-In Factor:** 🔒 **High** — Switching requires re-KYC, re-wiring payouts, recreating split logic, and re-exporting tax history.

### Ops: Intelligent Automation

**What It Does:**
- Personalized next-best actions
- Smart replies and summaries
- Playbooks tied to wallet & integrity signals
- Human-in-the-loop for sensitive topics

**Why It Matters:**
Lifts RPM/ARPU through intelligent nudges and reduces support load with automation.

**Lock-In Factor:** 🔒 **Medium-High** — Tuned behaviors and performance gains are costly to rebuild on another platform.

### Vault: Content Protection

**What It Does:**
- Perceptual fingerprinting
- Leak detection and matching
- Evidence pack generation
- Risk scoring and triage

**Why It Matters:**
Protects revenue by catching leaks early and providing enforceable proof of ownership.

**Lock-In Factor:** 🔒 **High** — Migrating requires re-fingerprinting entire library and losing enforcement history.
