## How They Work Together

### The Compounding Flywheel

<Steps>
  <Step title="Money Gravity (Oruon)">
    Creators start with the wallet for compliant earnings and payouts. This becomes their **financial system of record**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Workflow Gravity (Ops)">
    AI operations layer uses wallet signals to provide **intelligent guidance** that increases earnings and reduces support load.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Integrity Gravity (Vault)">
    Content protection creates **defensible proof of ownership** and enables enforcement, protecting revenue streams.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Reinforcement Loop">
    Higher earnings → more protection needs → better operations → increased earnings
  </Step>
</Steps>
