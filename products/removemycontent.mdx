## Responsible AI

### Privacy-First Approach

<Warning>
**Our commitments:**
- **Hash-first processing:** Content fingerprinting without storing full files when possible
- **No facial recognition** without explicit user consent
- **GDPR-aligned retention:** Data kept only as long as needed
- **Minimal data collection:** Only what's necessary for protection
- **User control:** Full data export and deletion capabilities
</Warning>

### Ethical Boundaries

<Accordion title="What We Do">
  - Perceptual hashing of user-uploaded content
  - Similarity matching for leak detection
  - Evidence gathering for authorized takedowns
  - Risk scoring based on match confidence
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What We Don't Do">
  - Facial recognition without explicit consent
  - Indefinite data retention
  - Unauthorized content analysis
  - Third-party data selling
  - Invasive monitoring
</Accordion>

## Lock-In Factor

<Tip>
**High switching cost through:**

- **Fingerprinted library:** Re-fingerprinting entire catalog is time-intensive
- **Enforcement history:** Loss of takedown documentation and outcomes
- **Active monitoring:** Gaps during migration create vulnerability
- **Evidence packs:** Platform-specific formats and proven templates
- **Lineage tracking:** Difficult to recreate provenance elsewhere
</Tip>
